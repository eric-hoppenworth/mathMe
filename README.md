# mathMe

### What is mathMe?
   mathMe is an platform for practicing arithmetic.
   mathMe is intended to be used by instructors or parents looking to provide extra practice to learners of basic math skills.
   
### So It's Just Like KahnAcedemy or MathXL?

  Not exactly.  Sites like KahnAcedemy and MathXL provide WAY more content in large variety of subjects.  These sites are also organized by grade-level or course name; this can make finding specific skill practice difficult for the less internet savvy.
  
  mathMe seeks to be simple.  We provide practice for just the four basic arithmetic opperations:  
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

Practice will come in two basic forms:
  1. Quizzes for practicing general skills.  The number of digits in a problem can be specified.
    - Ex.  59 + 23 = ? (this is difficulty level 2, because there are 2 digits in each opperand).
    
  2. Questions based on multiplication or addition tables.
    - Ex. 7 + ? = 10

### That's cool.  Sounds easy to use...but will the kids like it?

  I'm glad you asked.
  
  The quizzes can be presented in two formats:
  * Basic math problems presented on a page with no fluff.
  * Fun and engaging games that make you **want** to keep practicing. :tomato:

## It is worth noting that mathMe is still very much in its production stages.
